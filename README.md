# learning-tool
This is just learning how to write a bash tool, lol no real functionality
Maybe if I enjoy bash enough I'll write a tool, although I wouldn't expect it to be ground breaking, just a fun project while I'm in school who knows
Either way it'll be fun to watch the progress into it, otherwise maybe nothing will come from it?
